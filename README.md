# Algorithms and Data Structures in JavaScript

I wanted to learn more about data structures and algorithms so I decided to make take my own notes, code and solve exercises as a preparation for technical interviews

## How does this repository works?

To run this:

1. Clone this repository
2. Go to the project's folder and run

```
npm install
npm update
npm start
```

Inside of /src you'll find two folders, one for data structures and one for algorithms. Inside of each, you'll have other folders for each data structure/algorithm with theory, JavaScript representations and solved leetcode exercises. <br>

## So... what do I do?

1. Understand the theory
    - Go to the desired data structure or algorithm
        - Read the .md file
        - Learn the methods and understand why they work
    - Open the index.js and play around with those methods by console.logging objects and methods until you fully grasp the concepts
2. Apply what you learned by practising algorithmic problems - [LeetCode - Top Interview Questions](https://leetcode.com/explore/interview/card/top-interview-questions-easy/) - [Curated List of Top 75 LeetCode Questions to Save Your Time
