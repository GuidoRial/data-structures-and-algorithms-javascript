# Data Structures in JavaScript

I'm tired of being afraid of technical interviews and not being able to find a good source to learn this topic so I'll make one of my own

## How does this repository works?

It's quite simple actually, to run this:

1. Clone this repository
2. Go to the project's folder and run

```
npm install
npm update
npm start
```

Inside of /src you'll find one folder for each data structure, inside those you'll find different .js files and a .md file with theory about each data structure. <br>
This project is meant to summarize the theory behind each data structure as well as teaching you what each method do.

## So... what do I do?

1. Understand the theory
    - Go to the desired data structure
        - Read the .md file
        - Learn the methods and understand why they work
    - Open the index.js and play around with those methods by console.logging objects and methods until you fully grasp the concepts
2. Apply what you learned by practising algorithmic problems
