# Linear Search

In computer science, linear search or sequential search is a method for finding a target value within a list. It sequentially checks each element of the list for the target value until a match is found or until all the elements have been searched. Linear search runs in at worst linear time and makes at most n comparisons, where n is the length of the list.

## Complexity

**Time complexity:** `O(n)` since in worst case we're checking each element exactly once
